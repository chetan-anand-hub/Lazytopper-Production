# LazyTopper Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap preserves the staged implementation plan from the current PR-K2F checkpoint onward.

Latest verified live base:
```
base/approved-thru-437
24ac85f61752d1560ea29b26849bda4bb9b60c66
```

Current implementation branch:
```
feat/desktop-pr-k2f-practice-hpq-visual-grammar
```

Current stage:
PR-K2F / PR #72 is in progress. It updates Practice and HPQ old-format surfaces to match LazyTopper's Level-3 desktop visual grammar while preserving data honesty.

## Roadmap rule

Do not treat this roadmap as permission to skip audits.

Before each implementation stage:
- verify GitHub base
- inspect relevant files
- preserve allowed-file scope
- validate
- QA visible work
- audit GitHub diff before merge
- update handoff folder

## PR-K2F / PR #72 - Practice and HPQ Level-3 visual grammar alignment

Status:
Open and being updated. Not merged.

PR:
```
https://github.com/chetan-anand-hub/Lazytopper-Production/pull/72
```

Purpose:
Align Practice and HPQ with the desktop Level-3 product grammar. HPQ is a prediction-first execution surface, not a generic practice-mode page.

Completed in local repair:
- Practice visual grammar pass from earlier PR #72 commit preserved.
- HPQ moved into desktop shell.
- Old HPQ desktop chrome hidden.
- Prediction-first HPQ hero.
- Stronger Maths / Science toggle.
- Lightweight Refine predictions filters.
- Competency questions integrated into predicted stacks.
- State-aware mock basket with planning-only copy.
- HPQ self-check removed.
- Check my answer primary path for non-MCQ.
- MCQ / Assertion-Reason option click feedback where structured data exists.
- Check panel and steps panel mutually exclusive.
- Objective Solution logic avoids inflated marks.
- Duplicate answer-only objective logic row hidden.
- Student-safe step-solution fallback copy.
- Topic Hub returns to Predicted Questions.
- SolutionChecker restyled to desktop grammar.

Exit gate:
- TypeScript passes.
- Production build passes.
- Build verifier passes.
- GitHub diff scope is clean.
- Vercel preview works at `/app/`.
- Browser Agent QA or documented manual QA covers visible flows.
- GPT owner audits before merge.

## Post-K2F follow-ups

### MCQ structured options normalization

Purpose:
Normalize Science and Maths HPQ MCQ / Assertion-Reason data so click feedback can be available wherever real options exist.

Rules:
- data-only PR
- do not invent options in UI
- do not change grading/checking APIs
- keep `correctOption` explicit

Known Science audit:
- Science MCQ / AssertionReason total: 29
- Structured options/aROptions present: 14
- `correctOption` present: 14

### PR #72 QA repairs

If Vercel or Browser Agent finds visual or interaction issues, do a narrow follow-up repair on the PR #72 branch before merge.

### PR #69 / K2D

Status:
Still separate and not merged.

Rule:
Do not cherry-pick or absorb PR #69/K2D code into PR #72 unless explicitly approved.

### Mock grading to Mistake Intelligence

Future work:
Every mock that a student actually writes and gets graded on LazyTopper should eventually feed Mistake Intelligence and Me / Progress through real saved grading evidence.

Not part of PR #72:
- no fake mock score
- no fake progress
- no fake Mistake Intelligence

## Later stages

### PR-K3 - Check & Improve source-context integration

Ensure Check & Improve carries source/context from worksheets, practice, topic hub, HPQ, and other routes.

### PR-K4 - Mistake Intelligence from saved checked evidence only

Make Mistake Intelligence depend only on real saved checked answers and real mistake logs.

### PR-K5 - Me / Progress real aggregation

Aggregate real saved evidence into Me / Progress without fake time, score, mastery, or weak-area claims.

### PR-K6 - Tutor / examiner quality polish

Improve copy and guidance from student, tutor, and board-examiner lenses without claiming official CBSE marking schemes unless verified.

### PR-K7 - HPQ / Chapter Test / Mock output loop

Connect HPQ, Chapter Test, and Mock outputs into real evidence pathways.

### PR-J - Final desktop polish / parity sweep

Final visual, route, data-honesty, responsiveness, and preview QA sweep.
