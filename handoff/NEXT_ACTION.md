# LazyTopper — Next Action
# Updated: 2026-06-07 (post-PR #198 — CI ACTIVATED + CLAUDE.md corrected)
# Base SHA: 9d772cba602afcbae025b63f93b439dc9d38ebd0

## CURRENT BASE

Branch: base/approved-thru-437
SHA: 9d772cba602afcbae025b63f93b439dc9d38ebd0
Last PRs: #196 (fix: 3 pre-existing reds) + #197 (docs) + #199 (chore: de-Replit PR-A) + #200 (docs) + #201 (fix: regenerate pnpm-lock.yaml) + #198 (chore: CLAUDE.md fix + CI activation)

## CI IS LIVE (#198) — D39 RESOLVED
GitHub Actions now gates every PR into trunk (`.github/workflows/quality-gate.yml`): pnpm frozen install →
root matrix 175/175 → mojibake → linux build → ops matrix. CI pins **pnpm 10.32.1** (pnpm 11 breaks the root
preinstall guard on linux) and installs **ripgrep** (ops audits need it). Proven to run AND gate (probe PR
#202 went red on a planted mojibake). `scope:guard` is NOT in CI (working-tree-diff based → false-PASS on a
clean checkout) — it stays a LOCAL pre-commit gate. **No product-PR auto-merge** — human merge gate retained
until CI is proven over real PRs. HIGH-VALUE follow-up (OPEN_QUESTIONS): add `"packageManager":"pnpm@10.32.1"`
to root `package.json` so Corepack enforces ONE pnpm everywhere. See CURRENT_STATE (#198) + DECISION_LOG.

## DE-REPLIT — PR-A DONE (#199); PR-B NOW UNBLOCKED (the #198 lockfile regen landed via #201)
PR-A removed the lockfile-safe Replit scaffold + the dead `lazytopper-app/src` stub + dropped the dead-stub
filters from the root build (trunk `fec2f92`; authority `report-replit-removal-audit-2026-06-06.md`). **PR-B
(the lockfile-coupled remainder) is NOW DOABLE:** the `pnpm-lock.yaml` regen it waited on landed as **#201**
and CI proves a clean `--frozen-lockfile` install on linux. Regen the lockfile in the SAME path #201 used
(linux/Codespace, **pnpm 10.32.1** — match the version CI pins, NOT pnpm 11) when removing importers/catalog
entries, and let CI verify the result. PR-B scope: delete the `lazytopper-video`/
`mockup-sandbox`/`lazytopper-mobile` packages (all workspace importers; mobile = non-product Expo native path),
remove `@replit/vite-plugin-*` + edit the 3 stub vite.configs + drop the catalog entries, clean
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`stripe-replit-sync`, `@replit/*` exclude), remove the orphaned `@replit/connectors-sdk`,
and reconcile the root `typecheck` glob. KEEP `api-server` (real backend). The server Replit AI proxy
(Gemini fallback + entire Claude path) is a SEPARATE migration (needs API keys + backend deploy). See
CURRENT_STATE (#199) + OPEN_QUESTIONS.

## POST-#196 (housekeeping done; does not change the next HPQ task)
The three long-red ops suites (D38) are GREEN: mojibake 3/3 (re-encoded circles.proof.ts + the second
corrupted file maths.caseBased.ts the diagnosis missed), bank-health 4/4 (stale→retirement guard + orphan
dead-compute deleted), canonical 4/4 (re-pointed to the relocated practiceQuestionBuilder.ts). The
`check-mojibake.cjs` 50-hit scan cap (why the second file stayed hidden, and the local+CI blind spot) is
removed. **NEW tracked follow-up [D39]:** the mojibake guardrail workflow is mislocated under
`lazytopper/.github/workflows/` so GitHub never runs it — relocating + EXPANDING CI (gate the full matrix +
scope-guard, not just mojibake) is a deliberate infra change owed its OWN PR (verify uncapped checker clean
across all trunk first; decide trigger scope). Not blocking the next HPQ task.

## HPQ PHASE 1 — DONE (#194). Consistency + honesty (logic/copy/plumbing only).

HPQ now tells the SAME story as Exam Trends. Tier badges are driven from the locked tiers
(`LazyTopper_LOCKED_ExamTrends_Tiers_2026-06-05.md`) via a single canonical-key→tier lookup in
`getHighlyProbableQuestions()` — **0 tier contradictions (was 11/27); must-crack badge share 74%→42%**.
Dead `deriveHPQConfidence` compute retired (page shows no confidence UI; `hpqConfidence.ts` kept for a
future model). Copy reframed to honest "High-Probability Question Patterns" (representative shape, not a
specific-question prediction; three locked evidence sources named). Plumbing: canonical-key merge dedupes
the duplicate Pair-of-Linear / Metals cards; Science filter fix recovers Human Eye 1→4 and DEV-logs any
future drop. All questions KEPT (re-badge + de-emphasize, never delete). 3 files, +140/−36;
`predictionTypes.ts` frozen. Gates green; pre-existing reds (bank-health/canonical-gen/mojibake) verified
unrelated. Report `report-hpq-phase1-consistency-2026-06-05.md`. Trunk `6d5b6ed`. See CURRENT_STATE top.

## NEXT HPQ TASK — HPQ PHASE 2 (content authoring; gated `src/data/`, owner-validated, PYQ-sourced).

Phase 1 only RE-BADGED. Phase 2 adds/rebalances CONTENT — author from real PYQ sources, owner-validated:
1. **Missing every-year 5-mk Section-D Long-Answer marquee shapes** (the deepest "same story" gap): Trig
   Heights & Distances 5-mk LA; Surface Areas combination-of-solids 5-mk LA; Statistics grouped-median
   5-mk LA; Triangles similarity/BPT proof (Section D); Acids/Bases 5-mk LA; Chemical Reactions 3-mk
   displacement SA. (Maths currently has effectively ZERO valid 5-mk LA HPQs.)
2. **Distribution re-weight toward must-crack:** lift Circles (2) and Heredity (4) to adequate; trim or
   re-tier the over-stacked sets (Pair of Linear 8, AP 6, Metals 12) so volume over-indexes must-crack and
   tapers to good-to-do. (Phase 1 deliberately left volume alone — re-badging only.)
3. **`rn-hpq-4` Section-D/4-mark mislabel** — Section D = 5-mk LA in CBSE; fix the only Maths "Section D"
   item (currently 4 marks, which is why Maths reads as zero valid 5-mk LA).
4. **Backfill 49 competency `solutionSteps`** (the `*-comp-*` entries carry answer+explanation but no
   step-marked working) to the §13 CBSE step-marking minimums per section.
5. **Confidence-model reconciliation** — DEFERRED until a confidence UI is actually designed; re-base
   `compute5SignalScore` on blueprint-weight + 4-year frequency + §4 sub-pattern (so a band can never
   contradict a tier) before any confidence badge ships. See OPEN_QUESTIONS.

## EXAM TRENDS BAND REDESIGN — DONE (#190). Steps 5 + 6 complete.

The Exam Trends surface is now 3 collapsible priority bands (Must-crack / High-ROI / Good-to-do) on the
owner-signed-off locked tiers (`LazyTopper_LOCKED_ExamTrends_Tiers_2026-06-05.md`, transcribed VERBATIM).
The locked doc IS the fresh, scientifically-derived tiering D27 asked for (step 5), and #190 is the band
redesign (step 6). Layout-only Option-B evolution of the ONE component; 1 product file; "Expect:" line on
the 11 must-crack topics only; volatility flag on Trig + Electricity; no fabrication; grammar preserved.
Gates green (tsc, build, verifier, matrix 175/175). scope:guard FAIL = known monorepo path-prefix artifact
(verified not a breach). Trunk `cfb3106`. See CURRENT_STATE top section + SESSION_LOG.

## SYLLABUS-CORRECTNESS ARC — CLOSED (#186 + #188). Gating guard GREEN, matrix 175/175.

The content sweep (#188) deleted the 93-item worklist the corrected guard flagged → gating
`syllabusGuard` exits 0, `test:matrix:all` = 175/175 (incl. #19). Banks: Conversion of Solids ×46
deleted (canonical 6520→6474, spreads intact). Surfaces: EMI/Motor/Generator + Euclid/Frustum ×47
deleted/rewritten across predicted/HPQ/competency/config/trends/topics/topicHubContent + tutor
contracts. Owner decision DELETE-not-retag; blurbs/contracts rewritten syllabus-accurate. The tutor no
longer teaches Euclid's lemma or evolution evidence. See DISCOVERIES D26 (CLOSED) + D31 (deferred
polynomials follow-up).

## IMMEDIATE NEXT TASK — step 7: next Option-B surface (TopicHub concept-spine)

Exam Trends (the FIRST Option-B surface, #184) is now fully converged through its band redesign (#190).
The next track item is the next Option-B surface — **TopicHub concept-spine (+ Formula Sheet / NCERT
Notes)** — using the same template (ONE responsive component per surface; design grammar reused; honest
data only). Note the carried OPEN gate: the Notes/Formula template needs owner sign-off (structure,
granularity, #examples) BEFORE generation. Optional pre-step for #190: capture the 360/768/desktop ×
Maths/Science band screenshots as PR evidence (deferred — owner to request).

## THE SEQUENCE (owner-confirmed; reordered post-#186)

1. ~~Track A PR-1 — tutor wiring~~ DONE (#181 — desktop TopicHub "Learn this").
2. ~~PR B2 — teach-prompt tightening~~ DONE (#182 — LOCKED style; owner live-verified).
3. ~~Exam Trends ranked-list responsive redesign~~ DONE (#184 — FIRST Option-B convergence; merged `93a2674`).
4. ~~Correct + EXTEND syllabusGuard (the RULER)~~ DONE (#186 — corrected to official 2026-27; extended
   to 24 board-prep surfaces; 2 stale doctrine-locks fixed; merged `918b754`). The guard half of D26.
4b. ~~CONTENT SWEEP~~ DONE (#188 — deleted the 93-item worklist; gating guard GREEN, matrix 175/175
   incl. #19; banks Conversion of Solids ×46, surfaces EMI/Motor/Generator + Euclid/Frustum ×47;
   DELETE-not-retag; blurbs/contracts rewritten syllabus-accurate; trunk `e0395fc`). Closes D26.
5. ~~Re-derive Exam Trends priorities FRESH~~ DONE (owner-signed-off composite model + 2 teacher
   overrides → `LazyTopper_LOCKED_ExamTrends_Tiers_2026-06-05.md`; the scientific basis D27 asked for).
6. ~~Exam Trends band redesign~~ DONE (#190 — Must-crack / High-ROI / Good-to-do collapsible bands;
   reuses the merged ranked-list rows; the band replaces the weight-vs-trend Sort toggle; 1 product
   file; "Expect:" line on the 11 must-crack topics; volatility flag on Trig + Electricity; trunk `cfb3106`).
7. **(NEXT) Then the other Option-B surfaces: TopicHub concept-spine (+ Formula Sheet / NCERT Notes) →
   Check & Improve → Me/Progress → Worksheet generator** (each Option B; one responsive component per
   surface; same template as Exam Trends #184).
8. Separate follow-up PRs (not blocking): interactive-handoff fix (`findVisualForConcept` returns the
   WRONG visual — standard-angles showed Height & Distance); mobile-tutor wiring (mobile
   `src/pages/app/TopicHub.tsx` "Learn" is a placeholder → Check & Improve, NOT wired to concept_teach);
   Formula/Notes generation + content-correctness pass; AI cost/rate-limit hardening (launch gate, D25).
5. **Railway deploy** + `vercel.json /api/*` rewrite + rate limiting — the unlock that makes the
   Vercel link's AI features work (ISSUE-009) → hand students the link. At link-time: Clerk
   `pk_test_`→`pk_live_`, DPDP/consent for minors, monetization charge path.
6. **Launch chain (after the redesign + eval set):** check-solution eval set (40–60 graded answers,
   launch gate) + the tutor fabricated-solution correctness eval → Railway deploy + `vercel.json /api/*`
   rewrite + AI rate-limit/cost hardening (D25) → Clerk pk_test_→pk_live_, DPDP/consent for minors,
   charge path → hand students the live link. Deploy ONLY after grading + teaching are reliably GOOD locally.

## SUPERSEDED — old mobile-twin reflow track (replaced by Option B convergence)

The earlier mobile-reflow track (PR A #166 primitives → #168 mobile Home → #170 mobile landing →
#172 Home polish; staged usePracticeHub/MobilePracticePage) built mobile TWINS of desktop pages.
That approach is now SUPERSEDED by the LOCKED responsive Option B (DECISION_LOG 2026-06-03): one
responsive component per surface (desktop-leads, mobile-adapts), retiring both twins. The grammar
primitives (`src/components/grammar/`) and the `isMobileSelfChromedRoute` navbar pattern remain
useful building blocks for the convergence, but new work converges twins rather than forking them.

Remaining staged items (owner picks order & supplies the instruction + any frozen
design before each):
  - usePracticeHub extraction — reusable Practice Hub data/state hook
  - MobilePracticePage — mobile Practice reflow (consumes the hook)
  - (any further per-platform reflows for routes that render a desktop page at mobile
    width — verify render sites; RootEntry-style redirects mean not every site needs it)

Branch fresh from the current tip. Await the instruction (+ frozen art if any) first.

PATTERNS ESTABLISHED (reuse in PR C/D):
- Per-platform split: `isDesktop ? <Desktop/> : <Mobile/>` at the route (App.tsx edit
  permitted ONLY for that minimal branch). RootEntry-style redirects may mean only
  some sites need the switch — verify render sites first.
- Reuse without firebase coupling: lift shared, dependency-free logic into a small
  module (e.g. PR #168's src/lib/desktop/homeDestinations.tsx) imported by both
  variants; do NOT import a heavy page into a light one (pulls firebase into the chunk
  + unit test).
- Grammar primitives: import from `src/components/grammar` (`Card`, `TileRow`, `Pill`,
  `SectionHeader`). TileRow reflow is pure CSS (@media max-width:1023px); `columns` prop.
- Desktop-unchanged proof: keep edits to the desktop component module-level only
  (relocate declarations; never touch the component JSX) and show the diff hunks are
  all pre-component.

NOTE: build gate = `npm run build` (the real Vercel command); the Vercel PREVIEW
check on each PR is a valid pre-merge production-build gate. The false-green
`npx tsc --noEmit` was fixed in #164.

## RENDER-TEST INFRA NOW AVAILABLE (PR #160)

`npm test` in `lazytopper/` runs Vitest over `src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` (jsdom,
Testing Library, jest-dom; `window.matchMedia` polyfilled in `src/test/setup.ts`,
overridable per-test via `setMatchMediaMatches`). Every future UI PR (grammar
primitives, Mobile Home, practice-page extraction) MUST ship a real render/reflow
test as proof-of-work. The `scripts/` guard suite (137 tests, node:test runner) is
separate and unaffected — `vitest.config.ts` `include` is scoped to `src/`.

NOTE: the false-green `npx tsc --noEmit` was RESOLVED in #164 — `start:quick` now
runs `npx tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit && npm run build`, and `precommit:check`
was removed. Use `npx tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit` (or `npm run build`) for a
real app typecheck.

## LAUNCH TARGET

First week of June 2026 (~12 days from this handoff)
Primary use case at launch: chapter-by-chapter practice + worksheet generation
Filter complexity not needed by students until September (PT1 season)
Full timed mock + advanced filter system needed before October (half-yearly)
