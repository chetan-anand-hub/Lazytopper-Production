# LazyTopper — Next Action
# Updated: 2026-06-01 (post-PR #174 check-solution parse fix; AI gateway live on LOCAL dev)
# Base SHA: 5ad359c42127ac89056002c226828297ead7c98b

## CURRENT BASE

Branch: base/approved-thru-437
SHA: 5ad359c42127ac89056002c226828297ead7c98b
Last PRs: #172 (mobile Home polish — Vercel GREEN) + #173 (docs handoff post-#172) + #174 (fix: check-solution parse reliability — force JSON + raise token cap; local-dev verified)

## IMMEDIATE NEXT TASK — PR B: tighten grading + teach prompts (MEASURED)

The AI gateway is LIVE on local dev (non-stub, direct Gemini key) — prompts can now be
tightened against REAL Gemini output. PR B is the next product PR.

Scope (correctness/quality of the existing AI surfaces — NOT new features):
- Tighten the check-solution GRADING prompt to fix D21 over-classification: a sign-misread
  from a correct factor must be SILLY (not CONCEPTUAL); a propagated downstream error must
  be attributed to its single root-cause slip, NOT double-counted as a second mistake.
- Tighten the teach prompt(s) for quality against real output.
- MEASURE every change against a mistake-scenario test matrix (conceptual vs calculation vs
  silly vs presentation; single-slip vs propagated-error). Capture before/after on real
  answers/images. This is correctness work — keep the diff to prompts; no schema changes.

Prerequisite to RUN locally: gateway non-stub (`npm run dev:gateway` on :3001) + app
(`API_SERVER_PORT=3001 npx vite` → :25246). See D19/D20 in DISCOVERIES.md. Owner approves
before merge; PR report includes the GitHub PR URL.

AFTER PR B: check-solution eval set (40–60 graded answers, launch gate) → Railway deploy
(now IN scope — owner needs a live link for students to test tutor+checker quality) → hand
students the link. Deploy ONLY after the checker reliably returns GOOD grades locally.
Open at student-link time: Clerk pk_test_→pk_live_, DPDP/consent for minors, charge path.

## ALSO STAGED — next mobile reflow (owner-sequenced; lower priority than PR B)

Mobile track so far: PR A (#166 grammar primitives) → PR B (#168 mobile Home /browse)
→ PR C (#170 mobile landing /welcome) → PR D (#172 mobile Home polish + 5-tab light
BottomNav + single brand bar). NOTE: the owner re-used the "PR C"/"PR D" labels for the
mobile landing + Home-polish work; the earlier-predicted usePracticeHub extraction did
NOT happen yet.

NEW PATTERN ESTABLISHED IN #172 (reuse for future mobile pages with their own bar):
- A mobile page that renders its OWN locked-design brand bar must suppress the global
  public navbar at mobile width. Add the route to `isMobileSelfChromedRoute(pathname,
  isDesktop)` in App.tsx (pure exported predicate; `!isDesktop`-gated so desktop chrome
  is unchanged) and AND `!mobileSelfChromed` into the navbar render gate. Otherwise two
  brand bars stack. Consequence to accept: the global navbar's Search/Log-in are then
  absent on that mobile route.

Remaining staged items (owner picks order & supplies the instruction + any frozen
design before each):
  - usePracticeHub extraction — reusable Practice Hub data/state hook
  - MobilePracticePage — mobile Practice reflow (consumes the hook)
  - (any further per-platform reflows for routes that render a desktop page at mobile
    width — verify render sites; RootEntry-style redirects mean not every site needs it)

Branch fresh from the current tip. Await the instruction (+ frozen art if any) first.

PATTERNS ESTABLISHED (reuse in PR C/D):
- Per-platform split: `isDesktop ? <Desktop/> : <Mobile/>` at the route (App.tsx edit
  permitted ONLY for that minimal branch). RootEntry-style redirects may mean only
  some sites need the switch — verify render sites first.
- Reuse without firebase coupling: lift shared, dependency-free logic into a small
  module (e.g. PR #168's src/lib/desktop/homeDestinations.tsx) imported by both
  variants; do NOT import a heavy page into a light one (pulls firebase into the chunk
  + unit test).
- Grammar primitives: import from `src/components/grammar` (`Card`, `TileRow`, `Pill`,
  `SectionHeader`). TileRow reflow is pure CSS (@media max-width:1023px); `columns` prop.
- Desktop-unchanged proof: keep edits to the desktop component module-level only
  (relocate declarations; never touch the component JSX) and show the diff hunks are
  all pre-component.

NOTE: build gate = `npm run build` (the real Vercel command); the Vercel PREVIEW
check on each PR is a valid pre-merge production-build gate. The false-green
`npx tsc --noEmit` was fixed in #164.

## RENDER-TEST INFRA NOW AVAILABLE (PR #160)

`npm test` in `lazytopper/` runs Vitest over `src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` (jsdom,
Testing Library, jest-dom; `window.matchMedia` polyfilled in `src/test/setup.ts`,
overridable per-test via `setMatchMediaMatches`). Every future UI PR (grammar
primitives, Mobile Home, practice-page extraction) MUST ship a real render/reflow
test as proof-of-work. The `scripts/` guard suite (137 tests, node:test runner) is
separate and unaffected — `vitest.config.ts` `include` is scoped to `src/`.

NOTE: the false-green `npx tsc --noEmit` was RESOLVED in #164 — `start:quick` now
runs `npx tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit && npm run build`, and `precommit:check`
was removed. Use `npx tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit` (or `npm run build`) for a
real app typecheck.

## BANK STATE

Total questions: ~6,120
  - Authentic: ~3,341
  - AI-Generated: ~2,779
  - Board PYQs: 857 (all 4 main exam years complete)
    214 from 2022-23 (PR #135+#137)
    172 from 2023-24 (PR #147+#148+#150)

Retirement threshold: 4,500 (~74.2% reached)

## FILTER + STEP MARKS STATE

All filter chips working (post-PR #151):
  MCQ · Proof (broadened) · Competency · Assertion-Reasoning · Case-based · PYQ toggle
Section A + Remembering competency override active in 3 sites
Our Environment normaliser merged 156 split questions under one topic key
Step-marks guide-only banner removed for canonical bank questions

KNOWN ISSUE (post-#151): Proof filter still catches Section A conceptual
recall questions (subtopic contains "proof" or "identit"). Fix is one line
per file in practiceQuestionBuilder.ts + PracticePage.tsx — see ISSUE-007.

## IMMEDIATE NEXT TASKS (in order)

### Task 1 — Small fix PR: Hindi garbled + Proof Section A exclusion (P0 — before launch)
Branch: fix/remove-hindi-garbled-pyq (fresh, small)
Combines ISSUE-006 + ISSUE-007 in one PR.

ISSUE-007 fix (one line each in two files):
  Add at TOP of Proof branch in practiceQuestionBuilder.ts (line ~485) and
  PracticePage.tsx (line ~290):
    const qSection = String((q as { section?: unknown }).section ?? "");
    if (qSection === "A") return false;

Validation: 137/137 PASS, TypeScript exit 0
