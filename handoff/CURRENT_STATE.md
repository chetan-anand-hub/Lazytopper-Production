# LazyTopper — Current State
Last updated: 2026-06-03 (post-PR #182 — concept teach-prompt tightened to LOCKED style; tutor teaching quality resolved on desktop)

## Live base
Branch: base/approved-thru-437
SHA: fd0e7e9398eb6910855f0e1e08e030b71409253b
Last merged PRs: #179 (docs handoff post-#178), #181 (feat: wire concept tutor into desktop TopicHub — per-row "Learn this"), #182 (feat: tighten concept teach-prompt to LOCKED style — teaching now direct/no-fluff/on-concept with self-solved CBSE step-marking; owner live-verified)

## Tutor teaching quality (RESOLVED on desktop — B2/#182, live-verified)
The concept_teach tutor now teaches in the owner-LOCKED style: answers the exact question
first (no Namaste/persona/flattery/filler-analogy openers, no "interactive above" narration);
stays strictly on the opened concept (no topic drift); organizes by marks with concrete board
examples; ends with exactly ONE step-marking follow-up offer. On "yes" it SOLVES ITS OWN
example with per-step `[½/1 mark]` CBSE step-marking — math spot-checked correct across both
subjects; plain-text notation (no LaTeX leak). General across subjects (Science conceptual is
not forced into a "prove it" offer). LIVE path = `server/prompts/promptLearn.cjs`
(`buildConversationalTeachSystemPrompt`) + the concept branch of `buildUserPrompt` in
`server/routes/mentorModeHandler.cjs` — NOT `promptTeachContract.cjs` (see DISCOVERIES D24).
Residual: occasional late analogy on a long first-teach message (~1/13 turns) — eval-set territory.

## Governance / gates
- scope:guard: **LIVE again** — `SCOPE_GUARD_OK` on trunk. Was DEAD since `2081003`
  (a docs-cleanup chore) accidentally untracked `lazytopper/docs/project_memory/governance/
  repo_boundary_policy.json`, which two live scripts read; #176 restored it from history.
- `test:repo-boundary`: now RUNS again (4/5 checks pass). 1 pre-existing red:
  `vitest.config.ts` is tracked but matches no policy lane (`all_tracked_files_classified`)
  — backlog, deferred (see OPEN_QUESTIONS).
- LESSON (D23): a file-removal can silently break a live gate; `ci:smoke` runs only locally,
  NOT in CI, so the broken gate failed silently. Wiring `ci:smoke` into CI is the deeper
  fix (backlog).

## AI gateway status
- LIVE on LOCAL dev (non-stub): direct Gemini key in gitignored `lazytopper/server/.env`
  (`API_KEY` + `PORT=3001`); serverConfig auto-sets `AI_PROVIDER=gemini` + `STUB_MODE=false`.
  Boot proof: `Gemini: ON (gemini-2.5-flash) | Auth: direct-key`. Tutor (`/api/mentor`)
  and grader (`/api/check-solution`) both return real Gemini output locally.
- DARK in production until the Railway deploy (P0 ISSUE-009) + Clerk pk_live_ (P0 ISSUE-010).
- CONFIRMED 2026-06-02 (D22): testing the checker on the Vercel link returns "AI API request
  failed" — this is EXPECTED, NOT a bug. Vercel has no `/api/*` route to deploy to yet
  (ISSUE-009); AI features work ONLY on localhost (gateway up + `API_SERVER_PORT=3001`, per
  D19) until the Railway deploy.
- LOCAL DEV RUN: gateway = `npm run dev:gateway` (node server/index.cjs :3001); app =
  `API_SERVER_PORT=3001 npx vite` (:25246 → /app/). Both started SEPARATELY. See D19.

Render-test infra: Vitest 3.2.4 + Testing Library + jsdom (PR #160) — `npm test` in
  lazytopper/ runs src/**/*.test.tsx; 2 test files / 10 tests green (smoke + grammar);
  matchMedia polyfilled in src/test/setup.ts. Guard suite (137) unaffected.
Grammar primitives: PR #166 added src/components/grammar/ (Card, TileRow, Pill,
  SectionHeader, tokens, index) + the first real render test. TileRow reflows
  desktop↔mobile via a real @media(max-width:1023px) CSS rule (--lt-tile-cols var).
Mobile Home: PR #168 added src/pages/app/MobileHome.tsx (first page reflow) — the
  /browse cockpit now renders MobileHome below 1024px (isDesktop switch in App.tsx),
  stacking the 4 destinations via TileRow. Desktop DesktopHome render byte-identical.
  Shared firebase-free src/lib/desktop/homeDestinations.tsx (PRIMARY_CARDS + loginUrl)
  is the single source of truth for both Home variants. Vercel production deploy GREEN.
Mobile landing: PR #170 added src/pages/MobileWelcome.tsx — /welcome renders a
  swipe carousel (native CSS scroll-snap, 4 frozen v4 SVG cards) below 1024px
  (isDesktop switch in App.tsx). Desktop Welcome.tsx UNTOUCHED (zero diff). Sticky
  "Start free" → /browse (no gate); honest sub-line "7-day Premium trial — then free
  Basic, upgrade anytime." (never "then paid"). Vercel production deploy GREEN.
Mobile Home polish: PR #172 rebuilt src/pages/app/MobileHome.tsx to the owner-locked
  polish design (mobile_home_locked_final.html): illustrated gradient SVG icons per
  destination, orient-before-act order for new students, persistent per-row hints, and
  an inspiring Mistake-Intelligence panel with a clearly-labelled SAMPLE report + honest
  "Start free — find my reasons" CTA (real-data wiring on the firebase-free boundary;
  signed-in shows an honest empty state, never invented counts). BottomNav (App.tsx)
  recoloured to the light app grammar (white surface, soft border, green active /
  muted-slate inactive) and expanded 3→5 tabs (Home / Exam Trends / Practice / Check /
  Me) on canonical routes; visibility gate intact. theme-color #58cc02→navy #0f1b33
  (index.html) kills the green browser-chrome banner. Global public navbar suppressed on
  mobile /browse + /welcome (isMobileSelfChromedRoute, gated on !isDesktop) so each
  mobile page shows ONE locked-design brand bar — Search no longer on mobile Home
  (owner-approved; not re-added). Desktop byte-identical. Tests 19→32. Vercel production
  deploy GREEN.
Production build: GREEN. PR #162 added `exclude` to tsconfig.app.json so `tsc -b`
  (Vercel's `npm run build`) no longer compiles the dev-only test files. Vercel
  production deploy for the merge commit confirmed Ready/SUCCESS.
Dev tooling: PR #164 decommissioned the dead blackbox/tracker/pmem memory
  experiment (16 files: scripts + tools/pmem + tools/project-memory-blackbox-ext +
  blackbox.yml + 20 npm scripts). Repaired start:quick/start:safe to use the REAL
  `tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit` (killed the false-green bare `npx tsc --noEmit`).
  PRESERVED: .project_memory/ops/, docs/project_memory/, all scripts/ops/*,
  serverConfig.cjs. Vercel production deploy GREEN. Repo-wide refs to experiment: 0.

## Confirmed launch domain
lazytopper.in (owner-confirmed 2026-06-01 — NOT .app; earlier ".app" was wrong).
Verify DNS in Vercel before P0 gateway work starts.

## Owner clarifications (2026-06-01) — LOCKED
- Trial = ALL features for 7 days (full tutor + checker + everything), then reverts to
  free Basic. Gate is trial-not-paywall during those 7 days. No client-side premium/trial
  activation (doctrine unchanged): trial state comes from server/admin only.
- Fully responsive across ALL screen sizes — one fluid layout adapts at every width, NOT
  a 1024px desktop/mobile twin switch. This is more work than porting a mobile twin and is
  the target for the redesign (Track A).
- PR numbering follows git (next sequential, #175+). "PR-1..8" in the Track A breakdown are
  logical labels — map them to real git numbers.
- Two-track build, LOCKED: Track A (design/UI — fluid responsive redesign) + Track B
  (content: interactives via Claude, proofs, formula sheets, pre-generated PDFs) with
  robust content QA. Source specs are owner/architect-held (LazyTopper_Learn_Flow_Spec_
  LOCKED.md + LazyTopper_TrackA_PR_Breakdown.md) — NOT yet committed to this repo.

## Operating model unchanged
Chetan = owner/merger | Claude chat = architect/planner | Claude Code = executor
