## 2026-05-03 — Post K1C / Pre K2A checkpoint

### Completed in this session

- Audited and accepted PR-K1B / PR #51.
- PR #51 merged into `base/approved-thru-437`.
- Audited and accepted PR-K1C / PR #52.
- PR #52 merged into `base/approved-thru-437`.
- Updated durable project docs through PR #53.
- PR #53 merged into `base/approved-thru-437`.
- Established latest base SHA: `5a1bab9badb451b95d1d00a344421d5965f691c3`.
- Created handoff documents outside the repo:
  - complete master handoff
  - implementation-only handoff
  - working SOP
  - prototype/reference map
- Decided to use Codespaces terminal method for K2A instead of Codex.
- Codex was installed and authenticated, but should not be used as primary executor yet.
- K2A pre-audit found worksheet save is currently local-only and must first get a profile-save contract/helper.

### Important QA learnings

- Browser Agent can sometimes access Codespaces URLs.
- Browser Agent can also fail on Codespaces due to certificate / forwarding / gateway issues.
- If Codespaces preview fails for Browser Agent but works manually, classify as:
  ```
  INCONCLUSIVE — preview access limitation
  ```
- Do not call that a product route failure unless the app itself loads and fails.

### Next safe action

Start PR-K2A only after verifying live base:

```bash
git fetch origin
git switch base/approved-thru-437
git pull --ff-only origin base/approved-thru-437
git rev-parse HEAD
git status --short
```

Expected base:
```
5a1bab9badb451b95d1d00a344421d5965f691c3
```

Then create:
```
feat/desktop-pr-k2a-worksheet-profile-contract
```

K2A should be a helper/contract PR only.
