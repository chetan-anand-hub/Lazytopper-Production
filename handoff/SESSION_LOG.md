## 2026-05-05T02:32:56Z — PR-K2A repair: profile-saved status honesty

Timestamp:
- UTC: 2026-05-05T02:32:56Z
- Local/user time if known: not recorded in Codespaces

### Starting state

- Base branch: base/approved-thru-437
- Active branch: feat/desktop-pr-k2a-worksheet-profile-contract
- Current task/stage: PR-K2A repair after audit HOLD

### Work completed

- Repaired `saveWorksheetToProfile()` and `recordWorksheetActivity()` so Firestore/profile success returns `profile-saved` even if local cache write fails.
- Preserved `localCacheSaved` as the independent signal for whether local fallback succeeded.
- Updated K2A audit doc to clarify status semantics.
- No UI files or product surfaces touched.

### GitHub evidence

- PR: #58
- Changed files remain expected:
  - lazytopper/src/services/worksheetProfileService.ts
  - docs/audits/pr-k2a-worksheet-profile-save-contract.md
  - handoff/SESSION_LOG.md

### Validation evidence

- TypeScript: pending in this terminal run
- Production build: pending in this terminal run
- Build verifier: pending in this terminal run
- Changed-file scope: pending in this terminal run

### QA evidence

- Browser Agent: not required
- Manual QA: not required
- Preview URL: not applicable
- Verdict: non-visual repair

### Data-honesty audit

- Fake mastery: not introduced
- Fake score: not introduced
- Fake progress: not introduced
- Fake Mistake Intelligence: not introduced
- Fake saved history: not introduced
- Hidden persistence: not introduced
- Status honesty: repaired so profile/cloud success is not reported as failed

### Decisions made

- `profile-saved` means Firestore/profile persistence succeeded.
- `localCacheSaved` is the separate local-cache outcome.
- `failed` means neither local cache nor profile/cloud persistence succeeded.

### Session learnings

- Independent write attempts require independent status semantics.
- A local cache failure must not hide a successful profile/cloud save.

### Known issues / follow-ups

- PR #58 must be re-audited after this repair commit.
- K2B remains the next implementation step only after K2A merge.

### Next safe action

- Run validation.
- Commit and push this repair.
- Re-audit PR #58.

### What the next GPT session must verify first

- PR #58 head SHA.
- Changed files.
- Validation evidence.
- That Firestore success with local cache failure returns `profile-saved`, not `failed`.


## 2026-05-05T12:35:00Z UTC — PR-K2A: Contract repair and detailed result shape

**Timestamp:** 2026-05-05T12:35:00Z UTC / 2026-05-05 18:05 IST

### Starting state

Base: 8ff9a33be8345f201d54d91fdfe21f221093d537 (already verified from previous session)
Previous work: PR #58 drafted with initial K2A contract
Current branch: feat/desktop-pr-k2a-worksheet-profile-contract (fresh from previous session)

### Work completed

#### Repaired service contract
- **Fixed 5 contract design issues:**
  1. **No authClient check before local writes** → Accept uid: string | null | undefined; let Firestore rules decide
  2. **Local write honesty** → writeLocalJson() now returns boolean; reads back to verify actual success
  3. **Independent Firestore attempt** → Try Firestore even if local fails (don't skip early)
  4. **Null record for skipped-signed-out** → Return record: null when uid missing (K2B can distinguish)
  5. **Detailed result shape** → Added SavedWorksheetWriteResult, ActivityEventWriteResult with status, id, record, localCacheSaved, firestoreAttempted, firestorePath, errorMessage

#### Modified: lazytopper/src/services/worksheetProfileService.ts (550 lines)
- Updated saveWorksheetToProfile() to new signature and behavior
- Updated recordWorksheetActivity() to new signature and behavior
- Updated hydrateProfileFromCloud() to accept uid: string | null | undefined
- writeLocalJson() now returns boolean with read-back verification
- Removed getCurrentUid() (no longer needed)
- All functions now try both local and Firestore independently
- Detailed diagnostic metadata in result objects

#### Updated: docs/audits/pr-k2a-worksheet-profile-save-contract.md
- Added "Repair Details" section explaining each fix
- Updated "Current Service Contract" section with new result types
- Added "Result Shape" section with SavedWorksheetWriteResult / ActivityEventWriteResult description
- Updated "Returned Statuses" table with record behavior (null for skipped)
- Updated "Use Pattern Example" to check record !== null for skipped-signed-out detection
- Updated "Caller Responsibility" renamed to match pattern
- All sections now document the repaired behavior

#### Validation results
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✅ Production build: Built in 13.92s (faster than before)
- ✅ Build verification: 8/8 checks passed
- ✅ Scope gate: Only allowed files changed (service + audit + this log)

### Key Design Changes

**Contract signature before/after:**
```typescript
// Before
async function saveWorksheetToProfile(
  uid: string,
  draft: SavedWorksheetDraft
): Promise<{ status: WriteStatus; record: SavedWorksheetRecord }>

// After
async function saveWorksheetToProfile(
  uid: string | null | undefined,
  draft: SavedWorksheetDraft
): Promise<SavedWorksheetWriteResult>
```

**Result shape before/after:**
```typescript
// Before
{ status: WriteStatus; record: SavedWorksheetRecord }

// After
{
  status: WriteStatus
  id: string
  record: SavedWorksheetRecord | null  // null for skipped-signed-out
  localCacheSaved: boolean
  firestoreAttempted: boolean
  firestorePath?: string
  errorMessage?: string
}
```

**K2B can now distinguish:**
- `record !== null` means data persisted (either locally or profile)
- `record === null` means skipped-signed-out (should use device-only save instead)
- `status === "profile-saved"` means both local and Firestore succeeded (fully synced)
- `status === "local-only"` means data safe locally but Firestore unavailable

### Data-honesty audit

✅ **Repaired contract maintains strict data honesty:**
- Accepts uid = null and returns skipped (no fake persistence)
- writeLocalJson() verifies actual write success (no false positives)
- Firestore attempted even if local fails (no hidden failures)
- record: null for skipped prevents K2B from treating skipped as saved
- Error messages included for debugging (transparent about failures)
- Still maintains: generated ≠ progress, saved ≠ mastery, attempted ≠ checked, etc.

### Session learnings

1. **Contract design matters for caller convenience:** Detailed result shape with diagnostic fields makes K2B much easier to write correctly and debug problems.

2. **Boolean return from write operations is essential:** Not returning a status means caller must guess about success. Even read-back verification adds confidence.

3. **Independent write attempts are more resilient:** If we skip Firestore when localStorage fails, we lose the chance for cloud-backed persistence. Trying both independently is safer.

4. **Null is better than fake objects for distinguished states:** Returning a record object even for skipped-signed-out is confusing. Returning null is unambiguous and prevents K2B bugs.

5. **Audit docs must be specific about caller responsibility:** The audit doc now explains exactly what K2B should check (record !== null) to avoid mistakes.

### Known issues / Follow-ups

1. **K2B must use record !== null check** — Not just status === "skipped-signed-out"; the check must be explicit so refactoring doesn't break it

2. **K2B should display errorMessage** — If status is "failed", show errorMessage to user for transparency

3. **K2B should display firestorePath** — For debugging cloud issues, firestorePath in error messages helps

4. **Hydration still optional** — hydrateProfileFromCloud() is not auto-called; K2B or signin flow must call it if desired

5. **No progress inference from activity** — Even with detailed activity history, Me/Progress aggregation is K2D+, not K2A

### Next safe action

**For K2B implementation (next GPT session):**

1. Verify PR #58 is still in draft and up-to-date:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git switch --detach origin/feat/desktop-pr-k2a-worksheet-profile-contract
   git log --oneline -3
   # Should show: feat: add worksheet profile save contract
   ```

2. Review the repaired contract in worksheetProfileService.ts:
   - Signature: uid: string | null | undefined
   - Result: SavedWorksheetWriteResult (has record, localCacheSaved, etc.)

3. Wire DesktopWorksheetsPage save button:
   - Call saveWorksheetToProfile(uid, draft)
   - Check result.record !== null to detect skipped-signed-out
   - Use result.status and firestoreAttempted to display exact message

4. Update save labels:
   - "Saved to profile" (status: profile-saved)
   - "Saved locally; will sync when online" (status: local-only)
   - Fall back to device-only path if result.record === null

5. Run all validations before K2B PR

### What next GPT session must verify first

- [ ] Base SHA updated in handoff if merged to main (likely stays 8ff9a33 until K2A merges)
- [ ] PR #58 still exists and is draft
- [ ] worksheetProfileService.ts has new result types (SavedWorksheetWriteResult, etc.)
- [ ] Audit doc reflects Repair Details section
- [ ] This SESSION_LOG entry is readable and complete
- [ ] All files compile and build without errors
- [ ] Read the Repair Details section of audit doc before starting K2B implementation

## 2026-05-05T11:15:00Z UTC — PR-K2A: Worksheet profile save contract implemented

**Timestamp:** 2026-05-05T11:15:00Z UTC / 2026-05-05 16:45 IST

### Starting base

```
8ff9a33be8345f201d54d91fdfe21f221093d537 (origin/base/approved-thru-437)
```

### Work completed

#### Clean-start check
- ✅ git fetch, switch to base/approved-thru-437, pull --ff-only
- ✅ Confirmed HEAD exactly: 8ff9a33be8345f201d54d91fdfe21f221093d537
- ✅ Confirmed working tree clean
- ✅ Found and repaired polluted K2A branch

#### Repair of polluted branch
- Found local/remote `feat/desktop-pr-k2a-worksheet-profile-contract` pointing to old base
- Created backup: `backup/k2a-polluted-api-created-8ff9a33`
- Pushed backup for audit trail
- Deleted polluted remote branch
- Deleted local polluted branch
- Created clean K2A branch from current base

#### Implementation: worksheetProfileService.ts
- Created: `lazytopper/src/services/worksheetProfileService.ts` (414 lines)
- Implements typed contract for signed-in worksheet profile save and activity recording
- Exports:
  - `saveWorksheetToProfile(uid, draft)` → `{ status, record }`
  - `recordWorksheetActivity(uid, draft)` → `{ status, record }`
  - `listLocalProfileSavedWorksheets(uid)` → array
  - `listLocalWorksheetActivity(uid)` → array
  - `hydrateProfileFromCloud(uid)` → optional cloud fetch
  - Type exports: `WriteStatus`, `WorksheetActivityKind`, all record/draft types

- Write statuses:
  - `profile-saved`: written to localStorage + Firestore
  - `local-only`: written to localStorage only
  - `skipped-signed-out`: user not authenticated
  - `failed`: both writes failed (rare)

- Activity states (distinct, honest):
  - `worksheet_generated`, `worksheet_saved`, `worksheet_attempt_started`
  - `worksheet_attempted`, `worksheet_check_started`, `answer_checked`
  - `mistake_logged`

- Storage:
  - Local keys: `lazytopper.profile.savedWorksheets.v1:{uid}`, `lazytopper.worksheetActivity.v1:{uid}`
  - Firestore: `learnerProfiles/{uid}/savedWorksheets/{id}`, `learnerProfiles/{uid}/worksheetActivity/{id}`
  - Respects existing Firestore rules (isOwner(uid))

- Data honesty:
  - Generated ≠ progress
  - Saved ≠ mastery
  - Attempted ≠ checked
  - Checked ≠ logged
  - No automatic Me/Progress/Mistake Intelligence claims

#### Audit documentation
- Created: `docs/audits/pr-k2a-worksheet-profile-save-contract.md` (450+ lines)
- Explains K2A purpose, contract, paths, statuses, data honesty, non-goals
- Includes usage patterns, validation commands, K2B follow-ups
- Non-visual, contract-only work; Browser QA not required

### Validation evidence

#### TypeScript compilation
```
✅ pnpm --filter lazytopper exec tsc --noEmit
   No errors. Service compiles cleanly.
```

#### Production build
```
✅ NODE_ENV=production BASE_PATH=/app/ pnpm --filter lazytopper run build
   Built successfully in 15.98s
   Main JS bundle created with new service included
```

#### Build verification
```bash
✅ node scripts/verify-production-build.mjs
   8 passed, 0 failed
   ✓ Build verification PASSED — safe to deploy
```

#### Git scope gate
```bash
✅ git diff --name-only origin/base/approved-thru-437...HEAD
   (after staging)

Modified files:
- lazytopper/src/services/worksheetProfileService.ts ✅ ALLOWED
- docs/audits/pr-k2a-worksheet-profile-save-contract.md ✅ ALLOWED
- handoff/SESSION_LOG.md ✅ ALLOWED

No forbidden files changed (UI, worksheet generator, mistake services, package files).
```

### QA evidence

- ServiceTypeScript compiles with no warnings
- Build passes all checks
- Service does not touch UI surfaces
- Service exports are typed and documented
- Local-only fallback pattern matches existing mistakeLogService
- Firestore paths respect existing rules and subcollection structure
- No progress/mastery inference
- No automatic Mistake Intelligence claims

**Browser QA:** Not required (contract/helper only, no UI changes).

### Data-honesty audit

✅ Service maintains strict data honesty:
- Writes exactly what the caller provides (no inference)
- Returns honest `WriteStatus` (profile-saved, local-only, skipped, failed)
- Activity states are distinct (generated ≠ attempted ≠ checked ≠ logged)
- No progress claims; no mastery claims; no Mistake Intelligence claims
- No fake checked answers persisted as "solutions"
- No generated worksheets claimed as "catalog questions"
- Me/Progress aggregation deferred to K2D or later
- Mistake Intelligence deferred to K2D or later, requires saved checked evidence

### Decisions made

1. **Keep service separate from signed-out local save:** New keys (`lazytopper.profile.*`) are distinct from existing signed-out keys (`lazytopper.desktop.*`). No accidental mixing; clear intent.

2. **Always write localStorage first:** Ensures local-first durability. If Firestore fails, user can work offline. Matches mistakeLogService pattern.

3. **Optional Firestore hydration:** `hydrateProfileFromCloud()` is optional (not auto-called). Called on demand by sign-in flows. Respects existing local data; no overwrites.

4. **Defer Me/Progress to K2D:** Activity recording is data capture only. Aggregation, mastery computation, and Mistake Intelligence feed are K2D or later with explicit business logic.

5. **Use learnerProfiles/{uid} subcollections:** Consistent with existing mistakeLogs, sessions, messages. Firestore rules already protect per-UID. No new permission model needed.

### Session learnings

1. **Branch pollution is common in multi-session work:** Always check for stale branches. The repair protocol saved time and prevented merging incomplete work.

2. **Local-first + optional cloud is a robust pattern:** Matches existing mistakeLogService design. Allows graceful degradation and offline tolerance.

3. **Type exports are essential for callers:** Made sure to export all types (WriteStatus, ActivityKind, drafts, records) so UI/caller code is fully typed.

4. **Firestore hydration must be optional:** Forcing it can overwrite locally-newer data. Letting it gracefully no-op is safer.

5. **Honest statuses require careful thinking:** Distinguishing "profile-saved" from "local-only" from "skipped" from "failed" is more useful than a simple boolean. Caller can display meaningful feedback.

### Known issues / Follow-ups

1. **K2B must wire the save CTA:** Current UI still routes to local-only device save. K2B will connect DesktopWorksheetsPage to `saveWorksheetToProfile()`.

2. **K2B must update save labels:** UI labels must distinguish "Saved on this device" (signed-out) from "Saved to profile" (signed-in, profile-saved) from "Saved locally, will sync" (local-only).

3. **K2C must wire full learner loop:** Generate → attempt → check → see progress. Activity recording is ready; UI wiring is K2C.

4. **K2D must add Me/Progress aggregation:** Read activity history + rules. Compute progress/mastery. Update `learnerProgress/{uid}`. Feed Mistake Intelligence from saved checked evidence.

5. **Firestore permissions already allow profile subcollections:** Existing `match /{document=**}` rule under `learnerProfiles/{uid}` allows `savedWorksheets/` and `worksheetActivity/` collections. No new rules needed.

### Next safe action

**For next GPT session (before starting K2B):**

1. Verify base is still clean:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git switch base/approved-thru-437
   git pull --ff-only origin base/approved-thru-437
   git rev-parse HEAD
   # Expected: 8ff9a33be8345f201d54d91fdfe21f221093d537 or later
   ```

2. Verify K2A PR was already merged:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline | head -20
   # Look for "PR-K2A: add worksheet profile save contract" commit
   ```

3. Start K2B work only after confirming K2A is in base.

### What next GPT session must verify first

- [ ] Base SHA on GitHub matches handoff (currently 8ff9a33)
- [ ] K2A PR was created and merged (check GitHub PR #58 or later)
- [ ] No new K2A branches exist locally or remotely
- [ ] `lazytopper/src/services/worksheetProfileService.ts` exists and compiles
- [ ] `docs/audits/pr-k2a-worksheet-profile-save-contract.md` is readable
- [ ] Production build still passes with K2A changes included
- [ ] Read this SESSION_LOG entry + the audit doc before starting K2B

---

## 2026-05-04T18:04:56Z — Handoff roadmap and trackers added

### Completed

- Added `NEXT_ACTION.md` for immediate next task.
- Added `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` for full K2A → K7 → J sequence.
- Added `DECISION_LOG.md` for permanent project decisions.
- Added `OPEN_QUESTIONS_AND_FOLLOWUPS.md` for unresolved issues.
- Updated `README.md` file map and read order.
- Updated `CURRENT_STATE.md` to point future sessions to the new handoff structure.

### Session learnings

- The handoff system needs both immediate next action and full roadmap; otherwise future GPT sessions may know K2A but lose the larger K2 → K7 → J sequence.
- Permanent decisions should not be buried in chronological logs.
- Open questions/follow-ups need a separate file so they do not become accidental blockers or disappear.
- Revised Level 3 improvements still have no finalized canonical prototype, so implementation must proceed through product-native specs and QA gates.

### Next safe action

Start PR-K2A only after verifying live base and reading all handoff files.

## 2026-05-04T17:16:38Z — Handoff timestamp and learning rules added

Timestamp:
- UTC: 2026-05-04T17:16:38Z
- Local/user time if known: 

### Completed

- Updated handoff SOP rules so every future session must timestamp handoff entries.
- Added requirement that every session log entry includes “Session learnings.”
- Added requirement that handoff folder is updated at regular checkpoints and at end of session.
- Confirmed current base remains 7518d2fc4a181472b4dafd1969a41d96eec2ec3d.
- Confirmed next implementation stage remains PR-K2A.

### Session learnings

- The repo handoff folder is now the primary continuity bridge between GPT sessions.
- Future GPT sessions must be pointed to GitHub handoff files, not only chat summaries.
- Time/date stamping prevents ambiguity when multiple docs-only PRs or QA events happen close together.
- Session learnings must be captured in repo because they often contain the operational lessons that prevent repeated mistakes.

### Next safe action

Start PR-K2A only after verifying live base and reading:
- docs/desktop-graduation-state.md
- handoff/README.md
- handoff/CURRENT_STATE.md
- handoff/SESSION_LOG.md

## 2026-05-04 — Handoff SOP folder activated

### Completed

- PR #54 was created and merged.
- The permanent repo-native handoff folder is now active.
- The folder contains:
  - handoff/README.md
  - handoff/CURRENT_STATE.md
  - handoff/SESSION_LOG.md
  - handoff/templates/session-update-template.md
- Latest base after PR #54:
  7518d2fc4a181472b4dafd1969a41d96eec2ec3d

### Operating rule now active

Every future GPT session must update handoff/SESSION_LOG.md before ending.

Every future GPT session must update handoff/CURRENT_STATE.md when any of these change:
- current base SHA
- active stage
- PR state
- QA verdict
- next safe action
- major operating rule
- prototype/reference decision
- data-honesty rule
- environment lesson

### Current next safe action

Start PR-K2A only after verifying live base:

```bash
git fetch origin
git switch base/approved-thru-437
git pull --ff-only origin base/approved-thru-437
git rev-parse HEAD
git status --short
```

Expected base:
7518d2fc4a181472b4dafd1969a41d96eec2ec3d

Then create:
feat/desktop-pr-k2a-worksheet-profile-contract

K2A must be helper/contract only.

### Do not start yet with

- worksheet UI rewrite
- Me / Progress aggregation
- Mistake Intelligence claims
- AI solution fallback
- DesktopWorksheetsPage edits
- WorksheetReady edits

## 2026-05-03 — Post K1C / Pre K2A checkpoint

### Completed in this session

- Audited and accepted PR-K1B / PR #51.
- PR #51 merged into `base/approved-thru-437`.
- Audited and accepted PR-K1C / PR #52.
- PR #52 merged into `base/approved-thru-437`.
- Updated durable project docs through PR #53.
- PR #53 merged into `base/approved-thru-437`.
- Established latest base SHA: `5a1bab9badb451b95d1d00a344421d5965f691c3`.
- Created handoff documents outside the repo:
  - complete master handoff
  - implementation-only handoff
  - working SOP
  - prototype/reference map
- Decided to use Codespaces terminal method for K2A instead of Codex.
- Codex was installed and authenticated, but should not be used as primary executor yet.
- K2A pre-audit found worksheet save is currently local-only and must first get a profile-save contract/helper.

### Important QA learnings

- Browser Agent can sometimes access Codespaces URLs.
- Browser Agent can also fail on Codespaces due to certificate / forwarding / gateway issues.
- If Codespaces preview fails for Browser Agent but works manually, classify as:
  ```
  INCONCLUSIVE — preview access limitation
  ```
- Do not call that a product route failure unless the app itself loads and fails.

### Next safe action

Start PR-K2A only after verifying live base:

```bash
git fetch origin
git switch base/approved-thru-437
git pull --ff-only origin base/approved-thru-437
git rev-parse HEAD
git status --short
```

Expected base:
```
5a1bab9badb451b95d1d00a344421d5965f691c3
```

Then create:
```
feat/desktop-pr-k2a-worksheet-profile-contract
```

K2A should be a helper/contract PR only.
